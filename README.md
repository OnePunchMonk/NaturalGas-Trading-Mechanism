# Natural Gas Trading Strategy

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis and implementation of trading strategies for natural gas futures. The project covers data preprocessing, two distinct trading approaches, and a detailed theoretical critique comparing these methodologies.

## Project Overview

- **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare and clean the raw natural gas data.
- **Trading Strategies:** Implement and analyze two different trading approaches.
- **Evaluation & Visualization:** Assess strategy performance through quantitative metrics and visualizations.
- **Theoretical Critique:** Compare the methods based on simplicity, interpretability, risk management, and computational efficiency.
